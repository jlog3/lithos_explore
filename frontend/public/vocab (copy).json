These frequencies are often traced back to ancient musical scales used in Gregorian chants and sacred music, though the modern interpretation was popularized in the 1970s by Dr. Joseph Puleo, who derived six original tones from numerological analysis of the Bible. They are distinct from the solfège system (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti), which is a method for teaching pitch and sight-singing, despite sharing similar naming roots.\n\nThe commonly recognized solfeggio frequencies and their associated benefits include:\n\n174 Hz: Reduces pain and stress.\n\n285 Hz: Influences energy fields and promotes tissue healing.\n\n396 Hz: Liberates guilt and fear.\n\n417 Hz: Facilitates change and removes negative influences.\n\n528 Hz: Promotes transformation, DNA repair, and miracles (often called the \"love frequency\").\n\n639 Hz: Enhances relationships and harmony.\n\n741 Hz: Awakens intuition and problem-solving.\n\n852 Hz: Returns to spiritual order and awakens inner strength.\n\n963 Hz: Connects to higher consciousness and pineal gland activation.
